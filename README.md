## ðŸ“Š Data Integration

### Current Status - UPDATED AUGUST 2025
The CSV files have been corrected to match the authoritative Word document "State Legislation from Old SELT Map popups". All 5 corporate form files are now accurate.

### Data Sources & Methodology
**Primary Source**: Word document containing verified legislative data from old SELT map
**Corrected Files**: 
- `BCorps Summer 2025.txt` - 40 states with enacted BCORPs
- `L3C Summer 2025.txt` - 9 states with enacted L3Cs  
- `SPC Summer 2025.txt` - 4 states with enacted SPCs
- `BLLC Summer2025.txt` - 5 states with enacted BLLCs
- `SPBLP Summer 2025.txt` - 1 state with enacted SPBLPs

### Display Logic for Complex Cases
**Map Display**: Shows primary legislative outcome only (Enacted/Failed/Under Consideration/None)
**State Page Display**: Includes status notes for:
- Pending legislation (e.g., Michigan BCORP under consideration)
- Elimination attempts that failed (e.g., Rhode Island L3C - S.B. 2782 held for study)
- Related bills and amendments
- Conditional legislation with tie-bars

**Examples**:
- Rhode Island L3C: Map shows "Enacted" (2013), state page includes note about 2024 elimination bill held for study
- Michigan BCORP: Map shows "Under Consideration" (2024), state page details failed attempts 2018/2020/2023
- Connecticut BLLC: Map shows "Failed", state page details multiple bills 2017-2018

### Data Verification Complete
- Mississippi: 8 BCORP failures confirmed (2017-2024)
- Total enacted forms: 58 across all states and forms
- L3C unique cases: North Carolina (enacted 2013, repealed 2014), Vermont (first state 2008)
- SPBLP: Delaware only

### Option 1: Replace Sample Data (Recommended)
1. Edit `js/map-data.js`
2. Replace the `legislativeData` object with corrected CSV data
3. Maintain the same structure:
```javascript
const legislativeData = {
  2009: {
    'CA': { forms: ['L3C'], failed: [], rescinded: [] },
    'VT': { forms: ['L3C'], failed: [], rescinded: [] }
  },
  // ... more years
};
```

### Option 2: Dynamic CSV Loading
Add CSV processing to load your data files dynamically:
```javascript
// In map-app.js, add CSV loading functionality
async loadCSVData() {
  // Load and process your CSV files from /data folder
  // Use Papa Parse or similar library
}
```
